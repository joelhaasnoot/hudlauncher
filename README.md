# HUDLauncher

## Intro
This code is a bit on an experiment to create an Android launcher that doubles as a home control unit.
There's quite a few old Nexus 7 devices and/or Amazon Fire devices out there that this might work well with.
For now it's not complete: this was a 48 hour sprint to get the basics working. Lots of work is still needed to be able to configure this.
Especially the dashboard for now is just a UI mockup.

## Future 
I have plans on adding integrations for:
- Philips Hue
- Domoticz
- Home Automation
- Calendar
- Weather

If you have any great ideas, please open them as an issue.
